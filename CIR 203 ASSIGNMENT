Exercise 1: Financial Analytics (Banking Sector)
Topic: Python Lists  
Marks: 20  

`python
import numpy as np

Task 1: Create 2D array for 4 branches over 6 months
transactions = np.array([
    [1200, 1350, 1100, 1450, 1600, 1700],
    [1000, 1250, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1550],
    [900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150],
    [1600, 1700, 1650, 1800, 1750, 1900]
])

Task 2: Total transactions per branch
totalperbranch = np.sum(transactions, axis=1)

Task 3: Branch with highest total
highestbranch = np.argmax(totalper_branch)

Task 4: Average monthly transaction volume
average_monthly = np.mean(transactions)

Task 5: Reshape to 3x8 and provide insights
reshaped = transactions.reshape(3, 8)
insight = "Reshaping changes the structure of the data. While useful for certain analyses, it may lose the original branch-month mapping."

 Exercise 2: Logistics Management (Supply Chain Sector)
Topic: Python Lists  
Marks: 20  

`python

Task 1: List of delivery routes
routes = ["Route A", "Route B", "Route C", "Route D", "Route E"]

Task 2: Package counts
packages = [120, 85, 150, 95, 110]

Task 3: Merge into list of tuples
route_data = list(zip(routes, packages))

Task 4: Sort by package count (descending)
sorteddata = sorted(routedata, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

Task 5: Top 3 routes
top3 = sorteddata[:3]

Exercise 3: Medical Analytics (Healthcare Sector)
Topic: Python Tuples  
Marks: 20  

`python

Task 1: Patient tuple
patient1 = ("Alice", 30, "O+")

Task 2: List of 5 patient tuples
patients = [
    ("Alice", 30, "O+"),
    ("Bob", 45, "A-"),
    ("Charlie", 50, "B+"),
    ("Diana", 28, "O+"),
    ("Ethan", 35, "AB+")
]

Task 3: Blood type of third patient
thirdbloodtype = patients[2][2]


Task 4: Count of 'O+' blood type
opluscount = sum(1 for p in patients if p[2] == "O+")

Task 5: Convert to dictionary with names as keys
patient_dict = {p[0]: p for p in patients}

Exercise 4: Retail Analytics (E-commerce Sector)
Topic: Python Sets  
Marks: 20  

`python

Task 1: Product inventory dictionary
inventory = {
    "Laptop": 10,

    "Tablet": 15
}

Task 2: Add new product and update quantity
inventory["Headphones"] = 20
inventory["Phone"] += 5

Task 3: Remove discontinued product
inventory.pop("Tablet")

Task 4: Common products in two warehouses
warehouse1 = {"Laptop", "Phone", "Camera"}
warehouse2 = {"Phone", "Laptop", "Headphones"}
common_products = warehouse1 & warehouse2

Task 5: Merge product data
merged_inventory = inventory.copy()
merged_inventory.update({"Camera": 5})
